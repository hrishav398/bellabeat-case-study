## PREPARE

### **Data Source Description**

For this case study, I used public Fitbit fitness tracker data made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) on Kaggle. The dataset was originally generated by **30 Fitbit users** who consented to the release of their anonymized personal tracker data. The dataset spans the period from **March 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016** and includes daily, hourly, and minute-level activity logs for each user.

---

### **Data Storage**

The data was downloaded as 18 individual CSV files and stored in Google Colab for cleaning, exploration, and analysis. These files were then loaded into Pandas dataframes for manipulation and visualization.

---

### **Data Organization**

The data includes both **long and wide formats**, depending on the file:

* **Wide format** examples: `dailyActivity_merged`, `sleepDay_merged`
* **Long format** examples: `minuteStepsNarrow_merged`, `minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged`

Each file represents different dimensions of user activity such as steps, sleep, calories burned, and heart rate, and is organized either by **day**, **hour**, or **minute** depending on the granularity.

---

### **Data Credibility and ROCCC**

The dataset reasonably meets the **ROCCC** standards:

* **Reliable**: Data is sourced directly from Fitbit devices.
* **Original**: Provided by Mobius through Kaggle, with consent from participants.
* **Comprehensive**: Covers various metrics including activity, sleep, and weight.
* **Current**: Though the data is from 2016, it still reflects general usage patterns of wearable tech relevant to Bellabeat's business goals.
* **Cited**: The source is clearly stated and traceable through Kaggle.

---

### **Bias and Limitations**

* The dataset only includes **30 users**, which limits generalizability.
* The gender, age, and health backgrounds of the users are unknown.
* All users are from a specific time frame and may not represent seasonal trends.
* Potential **self-selection bias**: users who volunteered their data may be more health-conscious.

Despite these issues, the dataset is sufficient for **trend analysis and behavioral insights**, which is the focus of this case study.

---

### **Privacy, Licensing, and Security**

* The dataset is publicly available under **Kaggle’s open data license**.
* User identities are anonymized.
* No personally identifiable information (PII) is included.

---

### **Data Integrity and Suitability**

* The data was examined for missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
* Minor cleaning steps such as datetime parsing, column renaming, and null filtering were applied.
* Overall, the data is structured and clean enough to generate meaningful insights related to user activity, sleep, and calorie trends.
