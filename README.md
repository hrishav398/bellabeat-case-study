## PREPARE

### **Data Source Description**

For this case study, I used public Fitbit fitness tracker data made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) on Kaggle. The dataset was originally generated by **30 Fitbit users** who consented to the release of their anonymized personal tracker data. The dataset spans the period from **March 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016** and includes daily, hourly, and minute-level activity logs for each user.

---

### **Data Storage**

The data was downloaded as 18 individual CSV files. 11 files were stored in Google Drive and loaded in Google Colab for cleaning, exploration, and analysis. These files were then loaded into Pandas dataframes for manipulation and visualization.

---

### **Data Organization**

Each file represents different dimensions of user activity, such as steps, sleep, calories burned, and heart rate, and is organized either by **day**, **hour**, or **minute** depending on the granularity.

---

### **Data Credibility and ROCCC**

The dataset reasonably meets the **ROCCC** standards:

* **Reliable**: Data is sourced directly from Fitbit devices.
* **Original**: Provided by Mobius through Kaggle, with consent from participants.
* **Comprehensive**: Covers various metrics including activity, sleep, and weight.
* **Current**: Though the data is from 2016, it still reflects general usage patterns of wearable tech relevant to Bellabeat's business goals.
* **Cited**: The source is clearly stated and traceable through Kaggle.

---

### **Bias and Limitations**

* The dataset only includes **30 users**, which limits generalizability.
* The gender, age, and health backgrounds of the users are unknown.
* All users are from a specific time frame and may not represent seasonal trends.
* Potential **self-selection bias**: users who volunteered their data may be more health-conscious.

Despite these issues, the dataset is sufficient for **trend analysis and behavioral insights**, which is the focus of this case study.

---

### **Privacy, Licensing, and Security**

* The dataset is publicly available under **Kaggle’s open data license**.
* User identities are anonymized.
* No personally identifiable information (PII) is included.

---

### **Data Integrity and Suitability**

* The data was examined for missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
* Minor cleaning steps such as datetime parsing, column renaming, and null filtering were applied.
* Overall, the data is structured and clean enough to generate meaningful insights related to user activity, sleep, and calorie trends.

---

## Process

### Guiding Questions

#### What tools are you choosing and why?

I used **Google Colab** as my main analysis environment because it is cloud-based, allows Python coding with built-in support for libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**, and it integrates well with Google Drive. These tools are well-suited for handling large CSV files, performing data wrangling, and visualizing trends interactively.

---

#### Have you ensured your data’s integrity?

Yes. I ensured data integrity by:

* Verifying the data structure using `.info()` and `.head()` commands.
* Checking for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.
* Confirming consistency of timestamps and data types across datasets.
* Removing duplicate entries where necessary.

---

#### What steps have you taken to ensure your data is clean?

For each of the 11 datasets, the following cleaning steps were taken:

* Removed unnecessary columns like unnamed indices.
* Converted all time-related columns to consistent `datetime` format.
* Checked for and removed duplicate rows.
* Verified data types and corrected them where necessary (e.g., converting dates, integers, and floats).
* Identified missing values, especially in `weight_log_info.csv` (e.g., fat column) and excluded them from certain plots.
* Renamed columns or files when needed for clarity (e.g., removing “merged” from filenames).

---

#### How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?

The following checks confirm readiness:

* Used `.describe()` and `.info()` to confirm column data types and check for outliers or anomalies.
* Ensured timestamps matched logical ranges (e.g., no future dates).
* Confirmed row counts match expected entries (e.g., 24 hourly entries per day).
* Cross-checked related datasets (e.g., steps per hour vs. daily steps).

---

#### Have you documented your cleaning process?

Yes. All cleaning and transformation steps were documented within the Google Colab notebook using code comments and markdown cells. These records show which functions were used, the rationale behind cleaning choices, and any assumptions made during the process.

## Analyze

### Summary of Analysis

Using Fitbit user data, we analyzed trends in daily activity, heart rate, calories, sleep, steps, and weight metrics to uncover insights that could inform Bellabeat’s strategy. The data was aggregated, cleaned, and explored through multiple visualizations. Below are the key findings:

---

### Visual Data Analysis and Key Findings

1. **Heart Rate by Hour**  
   ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/heart_rate_per_hour.png)  
   **What it shows**: A line graph displaying the average heart rate (in bpm) across different hours of the day (0-23).  
   **Key Insight**: Heart rate is generally lower during typical sleep hours (0-5 AM), gradually increases during the morning and afternoon, peaks around 5 PM (17:00), and then slowly declines through the evening. The peak around 5 PM suggests that many users are most active or engaged in activities that elevate their heart rate during this time.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This information can be used for targeted notifications. For example, promoting evening workouts or winding-down routines could be effective. It also provides insights into typical user rhythms, which can inform feature development related to activity tracking and recovery.    

2. **Manual vs Automatic Weight Reports**  
   ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/manual_vs_automatic_weight_reports.png)  
   **What it shows**: A pie chart illustrating the proportion of weight reports that are manual versus automatic.  
   **Key Insight**: A significant majority (69.7%) of weight reports are entered manually, while only 30.3% are automatic.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This indicates that many users are not fully utilizing or do not have access to automatic weight tracking features (e.g., smart scales integrated with the app). Bellabeat could explore strategies to increase adoption of automatic tracking (e.g., promoting smart scale integration, simplifying the setup process, or highlighting the benefits of automatic logging for long-term trends). This could also inform whether development efforts should prioritize manual input improvements or automatic integration.  
   
3. **Correlation Heatmap – Daily Activity**  
  ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/correlation_heatmap.png)  
   **What it shows**: A heatmap displaying the correlation coefficients between various daily activity metrics (e.g., TotalSteps, TotalDistance, Calories, different types of activity minutes). Values closer to 1 (red) indicate a strong positive correlation, values closer to -1 (blue) indicate a strong negative correlation, and values near 0 (white/gray) indicate a weak or no correlation.  
   **Key Insight**:  
   <ins>Strong Correlations:</ins>    
   TotalSteps, TotalDistance, TrackerDistance, LoggedActivitiesDistance are all highly correlated with each other, as expected.  
   VeryActiveMinutes shows a strong positive correlation with Calories, TotalSteps, and TotalDistance. This is a crucial finding: more intense activity directly leads to higher calorie burn.  
   LightlyActiveMinutes has a moderate positive correlation with Calories.  
   <ins>Weak Correlations:</ins>    
   SedentaryMinutes generally has weak or slightly negative correlations with active metrics and Calories, which is also expected (more sedentary time means less activity and calorie burn).  
   Id (user ID) shows very weak correlations with most metrics, which is good as it indicates user variability rather than a strong bias from specific IDs.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This chart provides valuable data for understanding how different activity metrics relate to calorie burn. Bellabeat can use this to emphasize the importance of       VeryActiveMinutes for calorie expenditure and overall fitness goals. It can also help in designing activity recommendations and setting realistic goals for users, focusing on metrics that genuinely contribute to health outcomes like calorie burn.

4. **Calories Over Time**  
  ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/calories_over_time.png)  
   **What it shows**: A line graph displaying the total calories burned over approximately a month (mid-March to mid-April 2016).  
   **Key Insight**: The graph shows a general declining trend in total calories burned towards the end of the observed period. There are daily fluctuations, often showing a cyclical pattern (likely related to weekdays vs. weekends). The drop towards mid-April is quite significant.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: The declining trend is concerning. It suggests a potential decrease in user engagement or activity levels over time. Bellabeat needs to investigate why this decline is happening (e.g., lack of motivation, app fatigue, external factors) and implement strategies to re-engage users, such as personalized challenges, new features, or motivational reminders, especially as time progresses.  

5. **Heart Rate Boxplot – Day of Week**  
   ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/heart_rate_box_wisker.png)  
   **What it shows**: Box plots illustrating the distribution of heart rate values for each day of the week. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), the line inside is the median, and the "whiskers" extend to typically 1.5 times the IQR, with points beyond being outliers.  
   **Key Insight**: The median heart rate (the line in the middle of the box) and the overall distribution appear relatively consistent across all days of the week, hovering around 75-80 bpm. There are numerous outliers, particularly on the higher end, indicating periods of elevated heart rate (likely during exercise) that occur on all days.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This suggests that heart rate patterns are broadly similar throughout the week, implying consistent activity or basal metabolic rates. Bellabeat could leverage this consistency for general heart rate monitoring features or to flag unusual deviations that might indicate health issues or unusually strenuous activity on any given day.  
6. **Heart Rate Distribution**  
   ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/heart_rate.png)  
  **What it shows**: A histogram with a KDE, showing the frequency distribution of all recorded heart rate values.  
   **Key Insight**: The distribution of heart rate values is unimodal and approximately bell-shaped, with a peak frequency between 60-70 bpm. This range represents a healthy resting or light activity heart rate for most people. There's a tail extending to higher heart rates (up to 180 bpm), indicating periods of intense activity, but these are less frequent.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This provides a baseline understanding of user heart rate patterns. The peak around 60-70 bpm is normal. Bellabeat can use this to establish typical heart rate zones for different activities, offer personalized insights based on an individual's normal range, or alert users to unusually high or low heart rates that might warrant attention.  
7. **Calories Burned by Hour**  
   ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/calories_burned_hour.png)  
   **What it shows**: A bar chart displaying the average calories burned for each hour of the day (0-23).  
   **Key Insight**: Average calorie burn is lowest in the early morning hours (0-4 AM), gradually increases through the morning and afternoon, and peaks significantly in the late afternoon/early evening (around 5 PM to 7 PM). There's a slight drop-off after 7 PM.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This reinforces the finding from the heart rate per hour chart. The peak calorie burn in the late afternoon/early evening suggests this is prime time for physical activity among users. Bellabeat can target marketing messages, workout prompts, or activity challenges during these hours to align with existing user behavior and maximize engagement. It also indicates opportunities to encourage activity during the lower-calorie-burn periods.  

8. **Average Active Minutes by Day of Week**  
   ![Average minutes by day of the week](Visuals/average_active_minutes_by_day_of_week.png)  
   **What it shows**: A bar chart comparing the average "Very Active Minutes" for each day of the week.  
   **Key Insight**: Users tend to have more "Very Active Minutes" on Monday and Saturday, with Friday also showing relatively high activity. Tuesday and Sunday show slightly lower average very active minutes.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This insight can be used for strategic campaign planning. Bellabeat could:  
      <ins>Capitalize on peaks</ins>: Encourage users on Mondays and Saturdays with more intense workout suggestions or challenges.  
      <ins>Boost dips</ins>: Develop strategies to motivate users on Tuesdays and Sundays, perhaps with lighter, recovery-focused activities or different types of challenges to prevent a drop-off in activity. This could involve reminding users of their goals or offering gentle prompts.  

9. **Calories Burned Over Time with Confidence Interval**  
    ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/calories_per_time.png)  
    **What it shows**: A line graph showing the average calories burned over time, similar to "Total Calories Burned Over Time," but with a shaded area representing a confidence interval (indicating the variability or uncertainty around the average).  
   **Key Insight**: This chart confirms the declining trend in average daily calorie burn from mid-March to mid-April, as seen in calories over time.png. The shaded area indicates that while there's variability, the downward trend is consistent across the data. The sharp drop at the very end of the period is prominent.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: The persistent decline in calorie burn, despite daily fluctuations, is a critical finding. It suggests a need for long-term engagement strategies. Bellabeat should prioritize features that maintain user motivation over extended periods, such as personalized insights, progress tracking, community features, or adaptive goal setting. This decline could also signal the need to analyze user churn or disengagement patterns.  

10. **Distribution of Total Steps**  
    ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/total_steps.png)  
    **What it shows**: This is a histogram with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) curve, illustrating the frequency distribution of daily total steps taken by users.  
   **Key Insight**: The distribution is heavily skewed to the right, indicating that a large number of users take relatively few steps per day (peaking below 2,500 steps). While there's a long tail extending to higher step counts (up to 28,000+), these higher activity levels are much less frequent. This suggests a significant portion of the user base might not be meeting common daily step recommendations (e.g., 10,000 steps).  
**Relevance for Bellabeat**: This highlights a major opportunity for Bellabeat to encourage increased daily activity. Marketing could focus on achievable step goals, perhaps starting with smaller increments (e.g., "Add 1,000 steps today!") before aiming for higher numbers. The app could implement features like step challenges, goal reminders, or visual progress trackers to motivate users to move more consistently.  

11. **Proportion of Activity Minutes**  
  ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/total_minutes_by_activity_type.png)  
   **What it shows**: A pie chart displaying the percentage breakdown of total minutes spent in different activity categories: Sedentary, Lightly Active, Fairly Active, and Very Active.  
   **Key Insight**: This is a critical finding. An overwhelming majority (83.3%) of recorded minutes are categorized as "Sedentary Minutes." "Lightly Active Minutes" account for 14.2%, while "Fairly Active Minutes" (1.1%) and "Very Active Minutes" (1.4%) make up a very small proportion of users' total time.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This is perhaps the most important insight for Bellabeat. It reveals a highly sedentary user base. This presents both a challenge and a massive opportunity. Bellabeat should prioritize features and marketing messages that address sedentary behavior, such as:  
   <ins>Sedentary reminders</ins>: Gentle nudges to stand up and move after prolonged periods of inactivity.  
   <ins>Micro-breaks</ins>: Encouraging short walks or stretches throughout the day.  
   <ins>Education</ins>: Highlighting the health risks of prolonged sitting and the benefits of even light activity.  
   <ins>Gamification</ins>: Implementing challenges or rewards for reducing sedentary time.  
This data suggests that many users are likely not engaging in significant workout routines, but rather need encouragement for basic daily movement.  

12. **Total Steps by Day of Week**  
    ![Total Steps](Visuals/total_step_day_of_the_week.png)  
   **What it shows**: Box plots illustrating the distribution of total daily steps for each day of the week.  
   **Key Insight**:  
   The median steps (the line inside the box) are generally higher on Wednesday and Saturday, indicating these are days when users, on average, tend to take more steps. Tuesday appears to have the lowest median step count. The overall range of steps varies, with significant outliers (dots above the whiskers) showing some individuals achieving very high step counts on specific days.  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: Similar to the "Average Very Active Minutes by Day of Week" chart, this provides a daily rhythm for user activity. Bellabeat can tailor communications:  
   <ins>Reinforce high-activity days</ins>: Provide positive reinforcement or challenges on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  
   <ins>Boost low-activity days</ins>: Offer motivation or easy-to-do activity suggestions on Tuesdays to help users increase their step count. This could be a good day for "walk breaks" or reminders to get steps in.  

13. **Steps vs Calories**  
    ![Calorie per Minute](Visuals/steps_vs_calories.png)  
   **What it shows**: A scatter plot displaying the relationship between Total Steps taken and Calories Burned. Each point represents a single day's data for a user.  
   **Key Insight**: There is a clear positive correlation between total steps and calories burned. As the number of steps increases, the total calories burned generally also increases. The relationship is somewhat linear but also shows variability, meaning that for the same number of steps, different amounts of calories can be burned (this could be due to intensity, individual metabolic rates, or other factors not captured).  
   **Relevance for Bellabeat**: This confirms that walking and stepping are effective ways to burn calories. Bellabeat can leverage this direct relationship in its messaging and goal setting. For instance, explaining that "X extra steps can lead to Y more calories burned" can be a powerful motivator. It also suggests that encouraging any form of step-based activity is beneficial for users aiming for weight management or increased energy expenditure.
