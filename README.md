## PREPARE

### **Data Source Description**

For this case study, I used public Fitbit fitness tracker data made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) on Kaggle. The dataset was originally generated by **30 Fitbit users** who consented to the release of their anonymized personal tracker data. The dataset spans the period from **March 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016** and includes daily, hourly, and minute-level activity logs for each user.

---

### **Data Storage**

The data was downloaded as 18 individual CSV files. 11 files were stored in Google Drive and loaded in Google Colab for cleaning, exploration, and analysis. These files were then loaded into Pandas dataframes for manipulation and visualization.

---

### **Data Organization**

Each file represents different dimensions of user activity, such as steps, sleep, calories burned, and heart rate, and is organized either by **day**, **hour**, or **minute** depending on the granularity.

---

### **Data Credibility and ROCCC**

The dataset reasonably meets the **ROCCC** standards:

* **Reliable**: Data is sourced directly from Fitbit devices.
* **Original**: Provided by Mobius through Kaggle, with consent from participants.
* **Comprehensive**: Covers various metrics including activity, sleep, and weight.
* **Current**: Though the data is from 2016, it still reflects general usage patterns of wearable tech relevant to Bellabeat's business goals.
* **Cited**: The source is clearly stated and traceable through Kaggle.

---

### **Bias and Limitations**

* The dataset only includes **30 users**, which limits generalizability.
* The gender, age, and health backgrounds of the users are unknown.
* All users are from a specific time frame and may not represent seasonal trends.
* Potential **self-selection bias**: users who volunteered their data may be more health-conscious.

Despite these issues, the dataset is sufficient for **trend analysis and behavioral insights**, which is the focus of this case study.

---

### **Privacy, Licensing, and Security**

* The dataset is publicly available under **Kaggle’s open data license**.
* User identities are anonymized.
* No personally identifiable information (PII) is included.

---

### **Data Integrity and Suitability**

* The data was examined for missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
* Minor cleaning steps such as datetime parsing, column renaming, and null filtering were applied.
* Overall, the data is structured and clean enough to generate meaningful insights related to user activity, sleep, and calorie trends.

---

## Process

### Guiding Questions

#### What tools are you choosing and why?

I used **Google Colab** as my main analysis environment because it is cloud-based, allows Python coding with built-in support for libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**, and it integrates well with Google Drive. These tools are well-suited for handling large CSV files, performing data wrangling, and visualizing trends interactively.

---

#### Have you ensured your data’s integrity?

Yes. I ensured data integrity by:

* Verifying the data structure using `.info()` and `.head()` commands.
* Checking for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.
* Confirming consistency of timestamps and data types across datasets.
* Removing duplicate entries where necessary.

---

#### What steps have you taken to ensure your data is clean?

For each of the 11 datasets, the following cleaning steps were taken:

* Removed unnecessary columns like unnamed indices.
* Converted all time-related columns to consistent `datetime` format.
* Checked for and removed duplicate rows.
* Verified data types and corrected them where necessary (e.g., converting dates, integers, and floats).
* Identified missing values, especially in `weight_log_info.csv` (e.g., fat column) and excluded them from certain plots.
* Renamed columns or files when needed for clarity (e.g., removing “merged” from filenames).

---

#### How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?

The following checks confirm readiness:

* Used `.describe()` and `.info()` to confirm column data types and check for outliers or anomalies.
* Ensured timestamps matched logical ranges (e.g., no future dates).
* Confirmed row counts match expected entries (e.g., 24 hourly entries per day).
* Cross-checked related datasets (e.g., steps per hour vs. daily steps).

---

#### Have you documented your cleaning process?

Yes. All cleaning and transformation steps were documented within the Google Colab notebook using code comments and markdown cells. These records show which functions were used, the rationale behind cleaning choices, and any assumptions made during the process.
